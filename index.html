			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Stars are massive, luminous celestial objects that are made up of mostly hydrogen and helium gas. They are held together by their own gravity and emit light and heat through nuclear fusion reactions in their cores. There are billions of stars in the universe, each with their own unique characteristics and properties. In this website, we will delve into the classification, formation, lifecycle, and fun facts about stars.</p>

			<h2>Classification</h2>
			<p>Stars are classified based on their temperature, mass, and luminosity. The three main types of stars are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>O-type stars:</strong> These are the hottest and most massive stars. They have temperatures ranging from 30,000 to 50,000 K and masses up to 100 times that of the Sun. They have a very short lifespan and often end their lives in a supernova explosion.</li>
				<li><strong>B-type stars:</strong> These stars are intermediate in temperature and mass. They have temperatures ranging from 10,000 to 30,000 K and masses up to 20 times that of the Sun. They have a medium lifespan and often end their lives as neutron stars or white dwarfs.</li>
				<li><strong>M-type stars:</strong> These are the coolest and least massive stars. They have temperatures ranging from 2,500 to 3,500 K and masses up to 0.5 times that of the Sun. They have a long lifespan and often end their lives as red dwarfs or black dwarfs.</li>
			</ul>

		<section id="formation">
			<h2>Formation</h2>
			<p>Stars form from a process called gravitational collapse, where a cloud of gas and dust collapses under its own gravity. As the cloud collapses, it becomes denser and hotter, and eventually nuclear fusion reactions begin in the core, resulting in the formation of a star. The size and mass of the resulting star depends on the size and mass of the original cloud of gas and dust.</p>
