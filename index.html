      <h2>Introduction to Stars</h2>
      <p>A star is a huge, remote celestial object made of gas, dust, and plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Other stars are visible in the night sky when they are in the right location and the right conditions.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="types">
      <h2>Types of Stars</h2>
      <p>There are many different types of stars, including red dwarfs, yellow dwarfs (like our Sun), and blue giants. The color of a star depends on its temperature, with the hottest stars appearing blue and the coolest stars appearing red.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="formation">
      <h2>Formation of Stars</h2>
      <p>Stars are formed from giant clouds of gas and dust known as nebulae. As these clouds collapse under their own gravity, they heat up and eventually ignite, forming a new star. This process can take millions of years to complete.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="life">
      <h2>Life Cycle of Stars</h2>
      <p>Stars go through a life cycle, much like living beings. A star begins as a nebula and collapses to form a protostar. As the protostar continues to contract, it becomes a main-sequence star like our Sun. Eventually, a star will exhaust its fuel and become a red giant, and then eventually a white dwarf or a neutron star.</p>
